# Team Alpha-Omega: Student-Monitoring-System
A Real Time Student Attention and Facial Behaviour Monitoring System Using keras & Deep Learning.
 
### Problem Statement: A Real time dashboard that quantifies the participation for each participant. Real time triggers in case of sub-optimal participation. Suggestions (along with implementation) of other ideas to quantify level / quality of interactions.

Problem Description:
Due to this pandemic Everything has turned online due to the safety and Well-being of the students. And This is also made students so lenient and careless that students are disobeying the rules and utilizing this opportunity for bad things. Let it be Online Classes/Online Exams everything is being malpracticed. If it was in the class then the mentor or professor could monitor and take some action regarding the particular student but due to online every student has got this freedom which they are utilizing in a wrong way. which leads to poor grades and failing of exams. To Get this under control we have Designed a Deep learning model which monitors each student and Tells whether he is alert in this class or not by sending real time triggers.

This is a model where Every Student is Monitored with the help of Webcamera, where it detects the user's Eye ball movement and  His Overall Facial Expressions To Tell Whether he/she is focused into the class or not By giving real time trigger Alerts. This Model Acts as a Assistant to the Professors who is teaching the leasson that he/she doesnt need to waste time to monitor or handle the class. The model can also detect whether the student is Sleeping, Eating, laughing, distracted, or Passing Vulgar/Abusive Comments on the faculty etc and gives the complete feedback to the professor there by taking complete action on the student for his behavior. We Assure you that our trained model can give 85-90% of Accurate Result.

### Implementation
1.Drowsiness Detection:- This part of the code plays a beep sound when a student falls asleep during the class. If their eyes have been closed for a certain amount of time, weâ€™ll assume that they are starting to doze off and there by sending them

2.Emotion and Facial Behaviour Detection:- This is responsible for feature extraction of facial expressions with combination of neural network for the recognition of different facial emotions and Behaviours. It is based upon human face gestures as we know face also reflects the human brain activities or emotions.The software also works well even when a student is wearing glasses/spectacles.
